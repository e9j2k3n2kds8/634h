A simple whiteboard where you can drop videos and images. It has a few issues, such as saving as PNG etc., and PDF, but most of the functionality is there.

## Instructions:
- **Double-click** to center what you are looking at
- Use the **select button** for image and video placement
- Use the **hand tool** to move things around
- **Full screen** is available in the top right corner or press F11

Thanks!
